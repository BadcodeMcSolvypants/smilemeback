SmileMeBack is a unique application that helps people with autism develop language and communication skills faster and easier.

The app offers 2 user profiles. The content creator (e.g.: parent) and the content consumer (e.g.: autistic child)

Our research found that, when learning language, autists respond better when real pictures are used instead of hand drawn symbols and when the voice of the person they are closer to (e.g.: parents) is used to describe the pictures. 

We are not offering already-made content. Instead, we let the user build the type of content their child is mostly used to by using the camera of the tablet/phone and the incorporated microphone. This can be either objects that are very familiar to the child (e.g.: objects around the house, neighborhood, etc.), pictures of different facial expressions of the parent, relatives or friends (e.g.: smiling, acting sad, etc.).

The possibilities are endless. For example, the parent can easily create a category of actions/pictures describing the morning routine, basic mathematics operations, what to do in case of emergency situations, vocabulary and alphabet, describing objects, activities, feelings, etc.

We highly appreciate your feedback. 
Our app is free of charge and is ad-free (no advertising).
